# Irish Flower Classification
Testing and Training Dataset of Irish Flower ðŸŒº by using Pytorch

Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves classifying iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on the features of their flowers, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
In this example, Iâ€™ll show you how to perform iris flower classification using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

## Steps:

# 1 Load Iris dataset from Sklearn 
# 2 Split dataset into training and validation (Testing).
# 3 Create a neural network model (Number of weights).
# 4 Create a Losses and accuracy empty list to store weights which we are going to store
# 5 Optimize the data with learning rate
# 6 Train a dataset adjust the range and number of epoch accordingly.
# 7 Test the dataset which had been trained before.
# 8 Make sure to keep 80%-20% or 70%-30% ratio for training and testing (80% Training & 20% Testing)
# 9 Now Plot a graph to analysis the trend.
