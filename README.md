# Irish Flower Classification / Cat vs Dog Image Classification.

## Steps for irish flower classification:

### 1 Load Iris dataset from Sklearn 
### 2 Split dataset into training and validation (Testing).
### 3 Create a neural network model (Number of weights).
### 4 Create a Losses and accuracy empty list to store weights which we are going to store
### 5 Optimize the data with learning rate
### 6 Train a dataset adjust the range and number of epoch accordingly.
### 7 Test the dataset which had been trained before.
### 8 Make sure to keep 80%-20% or 70%-30% ratio for training and testing (80% Training & 20% Testing)
### 9 Now Plot a graph to analysis the trend.
